### Enhancing the User Experience at Food Magnet as a Software Engineer Intern

During my time as a software engineer intern at Food Magnet in Dallas, Texas, I had the opportunity to work on a project that aimed to improve the admin portion of the Food Magnet app. As a part of the development team, I was tasked with developing and implementing user interfaces that would make the admin view panel user-friendly, responsive, and scalable, while providing all the necessary information that the admins needed to perform their duties effectively.

### Developing User Interfaces with VueJS 

I was responsible for developing user interfaces for the admin portion of the Food Magnet app using the VueJS framework. The features I implemented included subscription levels, login information, and food truck statistics/metrics. The goal was to make sure that the admin view panel was not only functional, but also visually appealing.

### Ensuring User-Friendliness and Responsiveness 

I worked closely with the development team to ensure that the admin view panel was user-friendly, responsive, and scalable. This involved conducting regular user testing and feedback sessions to gather insights on how to improve the app's functionality and usability. I also reviewed and optimized team members' code to reduce redundancy and improve responsiveness across devices.

### Improving Website Loading Speed and User Experience 

As a result of my efforts to improve the code, we were able to achieve a 35% increase in website loading speed and enhanced user experience. This was a significant accomplishment that helped to improve the overall satisfaction of the users.

### Collaborating with Project Managers and Designers

In addition to working with the development team, I also collaborated with project managers and designers to ensure that the app met the requirements and deadlines of the project. I provided regular updates and feedback on progress, which allowed us to make necessary changes in real-time and keep the project on track.

### Working in a Fast-Paced Agile Environment

The Food Magnet project was developed using a fast-paced agile scrum project development environment. This required daily standup meetings and weekly sprint retrospectives to track progress and identify areas for improvement. As a team player, I participated in team-building activities and technical workshops to improve communication and collaboration among team members.

In conclusion, my time as a software engineer intern at Food Magnet was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to grow both professionally and personally. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on a project that had a positive impact on the user experience, and I am eager to continue developing my skills and making a difference in the world of software engineering.
