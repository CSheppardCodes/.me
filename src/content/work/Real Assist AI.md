### Real Assist AI: A Flutter App for Interacting with the RealAssist AI Chatbot

As I was applying for an internship at RealAssist AI, I was asked to create a Flutter app that would allow users to interact with the RealAssist AI chatbot using the OpenAI API. This app was designed to showcase my skills as a Flutter developer and to demonstrate my ability to work with APIs.

The RealAssist AI app is a Flutter app that provides a platform for users to interact with the RealAssist AI chatbot using the OpenAI API. It's simple to use and has a clean and attractive design. The app has two main features:

### Features ðŸ“‹

1. Retrieve responses from the RealAssist AI chatbot using the OpenAI API
2. Display responses in a scrollable list

When you open the app, you'll be taken to the home screen, where you can see a list of the latest responses from the chatbot. You can scroll through the responses to find the one you're interested in. The responses are displayed with the chatbot's response and the user's input.

### Getting Started ðŸš€

Getting started with the RealAssist AI is easy. Simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. You will need to have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed. In order to use the OpenAI API, you will need to sign up for an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once you have your API key, add it to the `main.dart`.
