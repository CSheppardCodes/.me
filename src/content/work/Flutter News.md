### Calmify: - Anxiety Managment Web App

Our app aims to instantly calm the mind for those suffering from extreme anxiety and panic attacks.

We use StyleGAN technology to generate a constant flow of calming images in an innovative way to provide visual support for these practices and help users find relaxation and peace. By focusing on these soothing visuals and messages, users can relax their minds and ease their worries, whether they are experiencing an anxiety attack or simply seeking a moment of tranquility.

The Calmify app allows users to instantly calm their mind using a method called fixed point meditation. It's simple to use and has a clean and attractive design. The app has two main features:

### Features ðŸ“‹

1. StyleGAN-XL: an image generation model. We implimented the image sythysis model onto AWS Sagemaker to produce a 30-fps 15 second video based on user input.
2. GPT 3.5 Turbo: a Large Language Model. We mobilized the OpenAI model to generate a calming story from user input in 5 seconds.


### Results ðŸš€

Our project was awarded 1st Place amongst 50 teams at HackAI by a panel of business experts. In just 24 hours our team created a flask web app with a responsive interface. Our app successfully implemented Fixed Point Meditation methodology for its user by generating calming animations with StyleGAN technology. We also gained experience with Amazon Web Services and a variety of programming languages such as Javascript.
